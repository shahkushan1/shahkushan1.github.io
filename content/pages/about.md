Date: 28th Oct, 2014

I am a Web Analytics professional from India. I work at [Tatvic](https://www.twitter.com/tatvic) where I mainly contribute to Product Development Team. I enjoy working on challenging data problems and creating end to end products. I enjoy programming in Python and R. I am also the maintainer of the [RGoogleAnalytics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RGoogleAnalytics/index.html) library.

This blog is an attempt to organise my thoughts on various disparate topics ranging from Analytics Tools, Data Pipelines, Recommendation Engines, APIs to Product Development, Company Culture.
