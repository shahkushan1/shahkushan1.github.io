Hi there, 

I am Kushan Shah. I am a member of the Platform Team at [Shopsense](https://www.shopsense.co/) where I focus on building backend components to support [Fynd](http://www.gofynd.com/).
I am extremely passionate about Computer Science and building things. Prior to Shopsense, I worked at Tatvic where I hacked on the
[RGoogleAnalytics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RGoogleAnalytics/index.html) library.

This blog is an attempt to organise my thoughts as I keep on experimenting and learning new things. You might find it filled with notes on my progress or the occasional rant about software development, programming in general.

If you would like to connect, feel free to [email](mailto:shahkushan1@gmail.com) me or find me via one of the networks on the left.
